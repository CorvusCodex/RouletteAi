## Installation

To install RouletteAi, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- art

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

'''pip install numpy tensorflow keras art'''

## Usage

To use RouletteAi, you will need to have a data file containing past drwa results. This file should conatin one number per each row, with each row representing a single draw and the single number in descending order, rows are in new line without comma. Dont use white spaces. Last row number must have nothing after last number.

Once you have the data file, you can run the `RouletteAi.py` script to train the model and generate predictions. The script will print the generated predicted number in console.
